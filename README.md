# RISCBoy 180

[RISCBoy](https://github.com/Wren6991/RISCBoy) is a Gameboy Advance from a parallel universe where RISC-V existed in 2001. It is a love letter to the handheld consoles from my childhood, and a 3AM drunk text to the technology that powered them.

RISCBoy 180 is a two-week project to flesh out RISCBoy into a fully functioning games console on a chip, and tape it out on GF180MCU on the first [wafer.space](https://wafer.space) shuttle.

## Acknowledgements

wafer.space provided me with a free slot on their first MPW shuttle. I'd like to think I was useful as a pipe cleaner to find issues with the flow, example project template, SRAM models etc, but this was incredibly generous of them, and a great learning experience for me. Thanks!

I didn't take any other payment.
