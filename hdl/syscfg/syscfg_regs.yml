regs:
  - name: mtime_tick 
    info: "The counter in MTIME increments once per MTIME_TICK cycles. This is
    intended to be a microsecond timebase, so set this register to the system
    clock frequency in MHz."
    bits:
      - {b: [5, 0], access: rw, rst: 24}
  - name: sram_chicken
    info: "The foundry SRAM models return incorrect data if
    chip select transitions on a clock edge. 99% sure this is just an issue
    with the model, but just in case, this register forces all SRAMs to be
    permanently enabled. You should clear this bit to avoid wasting power."
    bits:
      - {b: 0, access: rw, rst: 0x1}
